This is a simple one-class program that uses Java's FileTreeWalker. It includes two overridden methods.</br>
The program tallies up number of folders, subfolders and its storage size in whatever directory it is executed from.  </br>
</br>
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the author's skill and usage of the FileTreeWalker, as well as their familiarity with various Collections/Maps. </br>
</br>
It can be run in an IDE or compiled and executed via command line targeting Main.java. It is helpful to have subdirectories containing <i>n</i> files/folders to showcase the program's capabilities.
